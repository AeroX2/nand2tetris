# NAND2Tetris
My take on the Nand2Tetris course found at
[http://www.nand2tetris.org/](http://www.nand2tetris.org/)

The course consists of several parts starting with building the most basic components of
a computer, the logic gates and working up to build the memory, CPU, computer, compiler and more.

The details on how to run the projects can be found at
[http://www.nand2tetris.org/software.php](http://www.nand2tetris.org/software.php)
Software requires the Java runtime.
